# Bunestro

An Astro app with Tailwind CSS, React, Shadcn, and Tailwind-motion setup along with built-in utilities. [Live deployment](https://bunestro.ardastroid.com/)
Repo: [Github Repo](https://github.com/ardzero/bunestro)

## Getting Started

Create a new project using:

```bash
bunx @ardly/bunestro project-name
```

You can specify `-vs` or `--cursor` flags to auto open the project in VSCode or Cursor respectively after installation.

## Usage (run locally)

> Requires `bun` or `nodejs` installed and up to date

Go to the `root` folder where `package.json` exists.

> skip this if you're using the bunx @ardly/bunestro project-name command, it auto installs the deps

```bash
# Using bun
bun install

# Using npm
npm install
```

### Then

```bash
# or
bun run dev

# Using npm
npm run dev
```

> bun is not officially supported by astro, so if you ran into any problems, try using `npm` to see if it works before creating an github issue.
